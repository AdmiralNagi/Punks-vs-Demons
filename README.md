High concept statement: Evil and carnage is released and only the power of music can light the flame of passion that is required to defeat it.

Features: 
The player controls 4 band members that represent each of the four rows notes run down
Tapping notes as they overlap with the band members perfectly adds to combo and score.
Notes are synced with music.
The rest of the screen displays a clash between the band’s audience and a demon army.
Doing well decreases the size of the demon army while doing poorly increases its size.
This is represented by the audience fighting the demon army.
Longer combos causes demons resistance to drop.
If the demons resistance drops to 0 they break, causing score to double.
Missing notes causes demons to regain resistance.
Missing enough notes will make the demons break your audience and you lose.
Occasionally boss monsters will insert themselves on the note lines and charge the band.
Hitting the bosses like they were a note will lower their HP and knock them back further on line so they can attack again.
Getting hit by the boss will count as a missed note and the demon will jump back down the line to repeat his actions.

Further Details

The four band members will be based on typical JRPG classes such as fighter, healer, mage, and bard. The lead singer will represent the party’s bard, manning the vocals  and rhythm guitar. The lead guitarist is our party’s fighter, keeping up high intensity combos.  The bass player will represent our party’s healer, often overlooked but still the backbone of the group. Finally the mage will be our drummer laying out explosive solos in between steady beats. 
The demon armies will be pouring out of a portal to the hell dimension, unfortunately finding themselves in the middle of an aggressive and hyped up punk audience mosh pit in front of the band’s stage. The demon army attacks the audience but that only riles them up more, surrounding the demons and pushing back. Normally a demonic incursion would ruin a concert, but in this case it only adds the to the atmosphere. The band must keep the demons from wrecking the party by keeping the audience hyped up and ready to fight as they drive the demons back into the portal. 
We will look to have music provided by local punk bands, however in house created music or royalty free music is being considered.
